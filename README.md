# Pokersimulator
A javascript poker simulator that will hopefully have node.js incorporated for real-time play against other live opponents.  The end goal is to use this to make a neural network that is very good at poker with genetic algorithms and mutations.  My inspiration is Daniel Shiffman and the Coding Train.  I am also using the p5.js library for this.
